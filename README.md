Here’s a detailed overview of the technical architecture for Whizzify:

## Technical Architecture for Whizzify

### 1. Overview

Whizzify leverages a combination of modern web technologies, blockchain integration, and AI services to deliver a robust platform for automated quiz generation and reward distribution. The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, security, and a seamless user experience.

### 2. Architecture Components

1. **Frontend:**
   - **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating), UI Libraries (React or Vue.js).
   - **Purpose**: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for organizations to upload content, for participants to take quizzes, and for administrators to manage the platform.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Technologies**: Node.js, Express.js.
   - **Purpose**: Handles server-side logic, API endpoints, business logic, and interactions with external services and the database.

3. **Database:**
   - **Technologies**: MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL).
   - **Purpose**: Stores user data, quiz data, transaction records, and other application-specific information.

4. **Blockchain Integration:**
   - **Technologies**: Stellar Blockchain, Soroban for smart contracts.
   - **Purpose**: Manages secure and transparent transactions for reward distribution, ensures data integrity and tamper-proof records.

5. **Quiz Generation APIs:**
   - **Technologies**: OpenAI API, Gemini API.
   - **Purpose**: Processes session content and generates relevant quiz questions using AI.

6. **Wallet Integration:**
   - **Technologies**: Freighter SDK, Stellar SDK.
   - **Purpose**: Manages the creation, funding, and transactions of participant wallets for reward distribution.

### 3. Detailed Component Interactions

1. **Frontend Layer:**
   - **User Interface**: Developed using EJS templates combined with modern UI libraries (e.g., React or Vue.js) for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
   - **Interactions**: Users interact with the frontend to upload content, take quizzes, and view rewards. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs.

2. **Backend Layer:**
   - **Express.js Server**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and interacts with the database and external APIs.
   - **Business Logic**: Manages quiz generation requests, user authentication, transaction processing, and admin functions.
   - **API Integration**: 
     - **OpenAI API**: Sends session content to OpenAI for quiz question generation.
     - **Gemini API**: Utilizes Gemini API for additional quiz generation capabilities.
   - **Blockchain Operations**: 
     - **Stellar SDK**: Integrates with Stellar Blockchain to perform transactions.
     - **Soroban**: Executes smart contracts for secure and automated reward distribution.
   - **Wallet Management**: 
     - **Freighter SDK**: Facilitates wallet creation and transaction management for participants.

3. **Database Layer:**
   - **Storage**: Maintains user profiles, quiz data, transaction logs, and other critical information.
   - **Queries**: Supports efficient querying and indexing to handle large volumes of data and ensure quick data retrieval.

### 4. Workflow

1. **Content Upload and Processing:**
   - Organizations upload session content via the frontend.
   - The content is sent to the backend, which processes it and sends it to the OpenAI and Gemini APIs for quiz question generation.
   - Generated quiz questions are stored in the database.

2. **Quiz Participation and Engagement:**
   - Participants access quizzes through the frontend.
   - The backend retrieves quiz data from the database and presents it to participants.
   - Participant responses are evaluated, and correct answers are identified.

3. **Reward Distribution:**
   - For each correct answer, the backend triggers a transaction on the Stellar Blockchain using the Stellar SDK.
   - The Soroban smart contract ensures secure and automated reward distribution to participants’ Freighter Wallets.
   - Transaction details are logged in the database for transparency and auditing.

### 5. Security and Scalability

- **Security**:
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  - Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.
  - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
  - Utilize Stellar’s robust security features to ensure safe transactions.

- **Scalability**:
  - Design the backend to be stateless and scalable using microservices architecture.
  - Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple server instances.
  - Implement database sharding and indexing to handle large data sets efficiently.
  - Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.

### 6. Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment**:
  - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent and portable deployment across different environments.
  - Deploy on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and reliability.
  - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance and health.
  - Set up alerts for critical events and performance issues.
  - Regularly review logs and metrics to ensure smooth operation and quick resolution of issues.
